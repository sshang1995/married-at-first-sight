# married-at-first-sight

Context
The Lifetime reality television show and social experiment, Married at First Sight, features men and women who sign up to marry a complete stranger they've never met before. Experts pair couples based on tests and interviews. After marriage, couples have only a few short weeks together to decide if they want to stay married or get a divorce. There have been 10 full seasons so far which provides interesting data to look at what factors may or may not play a role in their decisions at the end of eight weeks as well as longer-term outcomes since the show aired.
